Internet voting system
######################

This is a prototype of fully end to end verifiable internet voting system.

The protocol
============

1. Central electoral commission (CEC) announce their public key.

2. Voters identify them self using e-government gateway infrastructure and
   register their public keys generated by voting client they chose to use.

3. Volunteers start mix-net daemons and announce their presence to CEC.

4. CEC announce data of all registered public keys together with digital
   signature of announced data file.

5. CEC provides API to check list of working mix-net nodes. Only those nodes
   working more than 1 hour are announced.

6. Voters send their votes using double envelope principle:

   1) Voters generate new pair of keys for vote identification and verification
      (identifier).

   2) Inner envelope contains vote value and identifier's public key.

   3) Inner envelope is encrypted with CEC's public key.

   4) Outer envelope is encrypted with public keys of randomly chosen
      mix-net nodes. Each encryption layer contains address of next node
      and envelope encrypted with public key of next node. 

   5) Prepared outer envelope is sent to first node, and first node will
      forward inner envelope to next node until CEC envelope will be found.

   6) Finally CEC will get vote value and identifier's public key.

7. Voters can send their vote many times, only last vote will be counted.

8. CEC announce votes and identifier's public keys from decrypted inner
   envelopes. Announced data are digitally signed with CEC's private key.

9. Voters receive announced voting data, find their identifier's public key,
   verifies and signs vote with identifier's private key. Signatures are send
   back to CEC.

10. CEC announce votes consisting of identifier's public key, vote signature
    made with identifier private key and vote value.

11. Everyone verifies signatures and counts all votes. Only signed votes are
    counted.

Additional notes
----------------

When CEC announce voters public keys, votes and signed votes, it has to be done
immediately and each received item should have hash value. This will make sure,
than order of received items was not changed. All clients can request new items
starting form given last item ID they have.
